<p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5; color: #444;">
I created this project to help save time when editing photos to fit Instagram posts. As we know, Instagram has changed its default feed preview to a 4:5 ratio to better support Reels content. While this change may not significantly affect portrait images, it can distort the composition and message of landscape photos, potentially undermining the photographer’s intent. Adding borders can solve this issue and preserve the original framing. <strong>InstaCanvas</strong> was built to make this process faster and more efficient, helping photographers save valuable time.

<ol style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.6; color: #444;">
    <li>Select and upload the photos you want to edit.</li>
    <li>Choose the canvas color. Only white and black are available at the moment.</li>
    <li>Select the canvas ratio. <strong>4:5</strong> fits best for Instagram, but <strong>1:1</strong> and <strong>9:16</strong> are also available for other purposes.</li>
    <li>Select the export size. <strong>1080px</strong> meets Instagram’s minimum resolution, but it may be too small and affect the original photo quality. For better results, upscale to a larger size.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Download</strong> to get the ZIP file, then extract and upload the edited files.</li>
