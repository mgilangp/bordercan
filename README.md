**PROJECT OVERVIEW**

I created this project to help save time when editing photos to fit Instagram Post. As we know, Instagram has changed its default feed preview to a 4:5 ratio to better support Reels content. While this change may not significantly affect portrait images, it can distort the composition and message of landscape photos, potentially undermining the photographerâ€™s intent. Adding borders can solve this issue and preserve the original framing. InstaCanvas was built to make this process faster and more efficient, helping photographers save valuable time.

**USAGE INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Select and upload the photos you want to edit.
2. Decide what color you want to pick to become the canvas color. Only white and black available at the moment
3. Select Canvas Ratio. 4:5 Ratio will fit the best. However for other purpose, 1:1 and 9:16 is also available.
4. Select the export size. 1080p will fit the minimum resolution for Instagram. However, I find that that size might be a bit small and affect the original photo resolution. I suggest to upscale it to a larger size.
5. Click download to download the zip file, extract then update the files.
